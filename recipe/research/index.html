    <h3>recipe reference 1:</h3>
    <h5>They've wrote a very detailed recipe to look at, however I feel like the recipe could be much more cleaner. Also, they didn't include the specific amounts of the ingredients. I like how they included tips and substitutions on the ingredients.</h5>

    <h3>recipe reference 2:</h3>
    <h5>I like how they first included a brief ingredients list, this helps the audience to know wheather they have the ingredients at the first place or not. I think the scrolling is abit to heavy and could be better. They could've had less pictures as well.  </h5>
