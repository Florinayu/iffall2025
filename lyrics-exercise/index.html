                <p>There's no reason, there's no rhyme</p>
<p>I found myself blindsided by</p>
<p>A feeling that I've never known</p>
<p>I'm dealing with it on my own</p>
<p>Phone is quiet, walls are bare</p>
<p>I drink myself to sleep, who cares?</p>
<p>No one even has to know</p>
<p>I'm dealing with it on my own</p>

    <p>I got way too much time to be this hurt</p>
<p>Somebody help, it's getting worse</p>
<p>What do you do with a broken heart?</p>
<p>Once the light fades, everything is dark</p>
<p>Way too much whiskey in my blood</p>
<p>I feel my body giving up</p>
<p>What do I do with all this time? Yeah</p>
