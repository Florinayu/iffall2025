      <h1>Legacy</h1>
      <p>Tucked away in an art gallery in the backstreets of Tokyo, two lonely metal boxes are almost all that remains of one of the city's most iconic and radical buildings.</p>
<p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower, completed in 1972, was once hailed as a revolutionary vision of urban living. Designed at the height of Japan&apos;s post-war boom, it wasn&apos;t just a building, it was an idea. A bold attempt to rethink how cities grow, adapt and survive.</p>
<p>For fans of this futuristic structure, it represented the pinnacle of architectural ambition. For others, it was a noble failure. Either way, the Capsule Tower is gone, but its legacy lives on.</p> 
<p>In the heart of Tokyo&apos;s Ginza district, the Nakagin Capsule Tower once stood as a testament to innovation. Designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa, the building was a striking example of Japan&apos;s Metabolist movement: a post-war architectural philosophy that viewed cities as living organisms capable of growth and regeneration.</p>
<p>Its 140 capsule units, each measuring just four metres by 2.5, were bolted onto two concrete towers like Lego bricks. Each one was prefabricated in a factory, trucked to the site, and installed in just three hours. </p>
<p>The idea was radical: when a capsule wore out, it could be swapped for a new one, just like changing the parts on a car.</p>
<h2>&quot;The Nakagin Capsule Tower was never meant to be static,&quot; explains Tatsuyuki Maeda, a preservationist who helped save several of the capsules from demolition. &quot;It was designed to evolve.&quot;</h2>
